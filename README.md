# Clean Architecture Node.JS API
Project developed using Node.js Whit Clean Architecture and TDD.

## Description
This project is aimed to demonstrate the implementation of Clean Architecture using Node.js. Clean Architecture is a software design principle that separates the business logic from the external world, such as frameworks, databases, and other external dependencies. This architecture allows us to have a highly decoupled and testable codebase.<br>

The project also uses Test-Driven Development (TDD) to ensure that the code is thoroughly tested, reducing the likelihood of bugs and errors. This approach to development results in a more reliable and robust application.<br>

Overall, the Clean Architecture Node.JS API is a solid foundation for building complex and scalable applications, making it an ideal choice for developers who value code quality and maintainability.
