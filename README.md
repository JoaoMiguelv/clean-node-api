# Clean Architecture Node.JS API
This is a project developed using Node.js and Clean Architecture.

## Description
This project is aimed to demonstrate the implementation of Clean Architecture using Node.js. Clean Architecture is a software design principle that separates the business logic from the external world, such as frameworks, databases, and other external dependencies. This architecture allows us to have a highly decoupled and testable codebase.
